Hi, my name is Glyn Davies and I've set up this blog primarily to record my progress through 100DaysOfCode but I may use it for other things as well.

I'm a physicist working in the NHS in Leeds in the UK and I've written bits of code on and off since my early days with FORTRAN as an undergraduate in Manchester. I've been meaning to get up to speed with Python for a while and decided that the 100 Days of Code challenge might provide the necessary focus. I'm going to work through the [100DaysOfCode in Python](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/details/100-days-of-code-in-python) course from TalkPython training but I've already spent a few days wandering down rabbit trails setting up Jekyll and git on various machines.  In parallel to the Python I'm also finally starting to use git and GitHub.

[I'm DrGlynDavies on Twitter](https://twitter.com/drglyndavies) where, in theory, I'll be tweeting my progress according to the rules of the [100DaysOf Code](http://www.100daysofcode.com) challenge.


## About the site ##

The blog is running on GitHub pages, created with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and using a hacked version of the [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com) theme.
