Day 6 Didn't do much coding but spent time reviewing the 'model answer' for the previous day's problem.  Saw that you can give enumerate a parameter to start at an arbitrary number - so setting it to start at 1 meant not having to add 1 to the output to print a list starting at 1. Also saw that you can slice the first 20 values from the sorted directory rather than having to use the counter to stop at 20. Much more pythonic :) 

Their solution made use of a single dictionary by replacing the original director:movies-list dictionary with a tuple key (director, agerage-score):movies-list dictionary. Wheras I had created a new dictionary of just the directors and average scores then used both to create the output.
