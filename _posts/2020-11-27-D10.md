Day 10  This is the start of using pytest. I watched the videos and decided to try out pytest on the iPad. I'm using pyto to play with the various python exercises but found that pytest didn't collect the tests when I tried to run it in pyto - it looks like a problem with the default directory being used. I'm also using a-shell on the iPad and that uses python 3.9 and I pip installed pytest and it works fine on the command line.  After a bit of playing I discovered that you can open other folders and bookmark them in a-shell. Therefore I opened the pyto directory and bookmarked it and once in there pytest runs fine. It's a bit of a kludge at the moment as pyto is using 3.8 and a-shell 3.9 but for playing around it's fine.
