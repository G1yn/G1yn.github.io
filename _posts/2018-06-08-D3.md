Day 3 of the 100DaysOfCode.  Not too much python today but instead there was a fair bit of setting up git.  I want to learn git at the command line and not rely on the various GUIs. Then over 100 days I should get pretty proficient! I generally use a mac and can make use of osxkeychain to help with credentials but at work I use a PC that is controlled by the hospital. I can't load with admin privileges so couldn't install the credential helper - hence to get access to GitHub I either need to type a long password each time or change to SSH - so I chose the latter. A bit of googling and reading the GitHub docs and I had it working. Also needed to update the bash init to make sure ssh runs with git bash.  I don't have time now but need to document the details for reference next time I need to do it!
