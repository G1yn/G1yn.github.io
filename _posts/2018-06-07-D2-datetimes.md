Day 2 of the #100DaysOfCode in Python. Progress: today I worked on datetimes and did Bite 7 from @pybites 100 days codechalleng.es - their solution was much more pythonic than mine and I have a lot to learn. However I did make it work. Needed to remind myself of how to split a string into a list and then how to convert a date time in string format into a datetime variable. It worked and over time I'll start to learn the pythonic way of doing things.  I did use a list to store all the lines that matched the necessary string but I built the list by appending within a for loop. The example did similar but embedded the for loop within the list generation.

I've also been reading up on git.  I've hardly used GitHub previously and I want to learn its features and the command line interface. I want to get into good habits and keep all my code here so by the end of 100 days I ought to be comfortable with this.
