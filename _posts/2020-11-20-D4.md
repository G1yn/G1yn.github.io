Day 4 of the 100DaysOfCode.  Well it has been a long time......   Some illness in the family and work pressures caused a long pause in the 100 days of code!  Covid 19 lockdown would have been a good time to make progress but working in the NHS didn't give that opportunity. Still, it's not like I haven't done any coding but nothing on this challenge so now I'm going to attempt to restart!
