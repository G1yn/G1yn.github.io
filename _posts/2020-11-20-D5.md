Day 5 of the 100 days of code but really the same day as day 4...  Decided to spend some time and do the pybites challenge number 13 which was the exercise for day 5.  Made plenty of reference to a few examples and the docs. Also some time with a pen and paper clarifying the structures I was working with. It was a success!
