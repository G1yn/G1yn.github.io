I've decided to do the #100 days of code challenge and I'll call today day zero. I've spent well over an hour learning a bit about GitHub pages and setting up this simple blog based on the Hacker theme.  Maybe I'll improve it over time but for now it's capable of logging my progress and keeping a few notes which was the purpose of setting it up.

I've signed up for the #100DaysOfCode in Python course from Talk Python and plan to work my way through that. My intention is to provide a focus for developing my python knowledge. Miniconda is installed and a python 3.6 environment created to play with. At some point I will get to grips with PyCHarm but for now I'll probably stick to Sublime Text 3.
