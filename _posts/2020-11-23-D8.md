Day 8 The exercise today was to do Bite 21 "Query a nested data structure" on Codechalleng.es. This was to pull data from a dictionary where the values were lists and to manipulate the data - sorting, searching etc.  I'll be interested to see the pythonic way of doing this in the solution. I used a couple of for loops where there may well be a better method and I haven't used complex searching or pattern matching so I did a simple .upper and .find approach which works but again may not be the most pythonic.
