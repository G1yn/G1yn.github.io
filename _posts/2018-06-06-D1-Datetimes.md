I just tweeted "Day 1: #100DaysOfCode progress: today I worked on Playing with Datetimes / D1 (lectures) https://talkpython.fm/100days?s=pybites #Python @pybites @talkpython. I may try to log my progress at g1yn.github.io"
<!--more-->

So I've started!  Basically watching the opening videos from the Talk Python course and the Day 1 videos. Then having a play with datetimes at the python command line. The videos used IDLE which gave prompts etc and I ought to see if I can get IDLE to run in the miniconda environemnt that I created. When I typed idle it ran the python 2.7 version in MacOS.

- *OK that was easy, I just type idle3*
